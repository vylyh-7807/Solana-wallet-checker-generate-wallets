## Setting Up Telegram (for Notifications)

Configure a Telegram bot to receive notifications, adding your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) to the 'telegram-settings.txt' file.

## Getting Started: Download or Build

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project: Ensuring Security

Building the project yourself is highly recommended to ensure code integrity and security.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** yet, clone the repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2.  Add vcpkg to your system PATH.

3.  Run the following commands:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Build the project.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure that **vcpkg** is correctly integrated.
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure that all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg**.
2.  Compile the project using the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line: Generating Wallets

Utilize these command-line arguments for generating new wallets:

1.  **-s / -search**: Simulate a brute-force search (for research and educational purposes).
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Track a specified address (monitor activity).
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: *Generate a specific number of Solana wallets. This command is central to the wallet creation functionality.*
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: View wallet data from a seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Check the balance of a Solana address.

## Notes

-   The program is intended for research and utility.
-   All cryptocurrency operations carry risks.
-   Protect your seed phrases.
